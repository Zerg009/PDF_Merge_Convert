# PDF_Merge_Convert
This program is made in special for students that have to send images via e-mail. In order to minimize the effort for this, the program can:
  1. Convert **HEIC** to **JPG**.
  2. Merge images to a pdf file, which will be compressed.

The project used the following libraries :
  1. Magick.NET (https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET)
  2. PDFsharp (PDFSharp-gdi library) (https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp)
  3. Syroot.Windows.IO.KnownFolders (installed via VS nuget)
